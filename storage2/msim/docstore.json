The admit rate for the\u00a0Mid-Career program has generally been above 80 percent. The\nonline mode is new as of 2021, so data for those tracks is not yet available.

Q: Can I take\nclasses in the MSIM program before being admitted? A: If you would like to take iSchool courses\nwithout formerly being in a program, please read all the information for taking classes as a\nnon-degree-seeking student . Q: Do you accept transfer credits? A: No, the MSIM program does not\naccept transfer credits. Q: How many times do you admit applicants each year? A: For the degree\ntracks in residential mode, we\u00a0admit students for autumn quarter only. For the online mode ,\nstudents can begin in any academic quarter. Q: Are applicants allowed to defer enrollment to a\ndifferent quarter or year? A: For residential students, if there is a strong chance you will not be able\nto start the MSIM program in autumn, please wait until the next cycle to submit an application.\nAdmitted\u00a0students can request a deferral, however, these requests are only approved in the event of\nrare extenuating circumstances. Q: I am a Washington state resident. Am I eligible for a tuition\nwaiver or reduction? A: All of the MSIM programs are self-sustaining and are not supported by state\nfunds. As a result, all applicants (in-state, out of state and international; residential or online) pay the\nsame tuition. Q: I am a Washington state employee. Am I eligible for a tuition waiver or reduction? A:\nThe UW tuition-exemption benefit applies only to state-supported programs, and not self-sustaining\nprograms. Therefore, MSIM students who are Washington state employees do not qualify for the\ntuition exemption. Q: How do I qualify for an iSchool scholarship? A: The iSchool has a limited\nnumber of merit-based scholarships available each year. All applicants to the MSIM program who\napply by the deadline are automatically considered for these awards. Recipients will be notified\nshortly after admissions decisions are conveyed. Q: How does the MSIM admissions committee\nmake admissions decisions?

Our faculty are integrating learning objectives and educational activities related to the\nskillful and critical use of AI-based tools in our classes. Additionally, our faculty are designing and\nleading courses on Building & Applying Large Language Models, Epistemological Foundations of AI,\nGenerative AI Ethics, and Implementing & Managing Artificial Intelligence Systems to prepare\nstudents for the evolving world. Students are also able to enroll in elective courses focused on\nspecial topics in Information Management, such as People Analytics, Cloud Computing,\nFoundations of Entrepreneurship, and more.

Current students seeking complete curriculum and track\ninformation for advising purposes should visit the online and residential handbooks respectively.\nInternships The benefits of experiential learning outside of the classroom cannot be overstated,\nwhich is why MSIM students often pursue internships for course credit during their academic\njourney. The process of seeking out opportunities, making the case for how they can add value to\ntheir organization, and then demonstrating to their new colleagues that value all the while making\nconnections in the Seattle area mirrors the process students will encounter as they leave graduate\nschool.

Information\ntechnology workplaces continue to explore how best to include neurodivergent employees in their\nworkplaces, as well as how to design information technologies accessible to the neurodivergent\ncommunity. This DRG will explore issues around employment and technology design to serve\nneurodivergent people. INSC 578 B: Research Seminar - AI Bias Feedback Cycle Instructor: Aylin\nCaliskan 2 credits; Credit/No-credit grading This is a directed research group (DRG) on the artificial\nintelligence (AI) bias cycle to study the implicit social cognition of machines and human-AI\ninteraction (HAI). We have open research questions on how implicit AI associations and biases\npropagate from society to models and their decisions. How do biased AI outputs affect\nhumans-in-the-loop in critical decision-making processes as humans interact with AI? How does\nimplicit AI bias impact individuals, society, and equity at scale? What are the ethical implications?\nHow do the compounding effects of these mechanisms shape society and the future generations of\nAI models? Finally, how do we develop strategies to mitigate bias? Social cognition of machines:\nWe will research why AI automatically learns implicit bias from sociocultural data by developing\nstatistical methods and algorithms, collecting data, training models in controlled experimental\nsettings, and analyzing machine learning models. We will focus on unsupervised and\nself-supervised AI models such as static word embeddings and dynamic word embeddings of\nlanguage models (English or multilingual), multi-modal language-vision models, or speech models.\nBiases of interest are on age, all representations of gender, body-weight, disability, immigration,\nreligion, intersectionality, language, nationality, race or ethnicity, political orientation, sexual\norientation, and social class. I?d love to hear about any other concept or social group associations\nyou might be interested in studying.

LIS 598 A: Trauma-Informed\nCare and the Library Profession Instructor: Karen Fisher 3-credits; standard grading This course\nreflects findings from my current IMLS study on the effects of workplace trauma on library staff. The\ncourse will cover the nature of trauma, types of library workplace trauma and susceptibility, and\nmethods of prevention, treatment, and awareness-raising. This course is novel: while\ntrauma-informed care has been used to design library services, it hasn't been developed for library\nstaff. LIS 598 D: Library Collaboration and Partnership Instructor: Lorcan Dempsey 4-credits;\nstandard grading No library is an island. Libraries are embedded in multiple collaborative and\npartner networks to get their work done. Participation in, and management of, these network\nrelations is a central part of a library's work. Several sets of relations are especially important. 1.\nLibraries work with other libraries in consortia - to negotiate, to share systems and collections, to\nlearn and innovate, and to lobby and concentrate their influence. 2. Libraries collaborate with\ncommunity partners to co-create or deliver services. This might include the Teaching and Learning\nCenter or Office of Research for the academic library, or Departments of Arts and Culture or\nEducation, or a local Community College, for the public library. 3. Libraries work with vendors and\nmay have long term relationships with suppliers. 4. Libraries may work with groups of users to\nco-create services, to get feedback, to evolve. It is important for libraries to recognize these\nrelationships in their strategy, planning and management. To make decisions and allocate resources\naccordingly, and to decide when to collaborate and partner to get things done and when to do it\nthemselves. This course will include opportunities to learn from library leaders, consortium leaders\nand others. The course will focus on public and academic libraries, but the principles and practices\nare broadly applicable.

Get\nyour questions answered below. Q: Is an online MSIM degree the same as a residential MSIM\ndegree? A: Yes. Admissions and graduation requirements for residential and online students are\nidentical and all graduates earn the same Master of Science in Information Management degree. Q:\nWhat are the differences between the residential and online delivery modes? A: All MSIM degree\noptions (Early-Career, Early-Career Accelerated and Mid-Career) are offered in two modes,\nresidential and online. The courses, credits and requirements are all the same. Key differences:\nProgram start dates: Students in the online option\u00a0have four opportunities to begin the program each\nyear (September, January, March, June). Conversely, all new residential students matriculate in\nAutumn. Application process: Application processes and timelines vary by degree option and\nmodality, and candidates are advised to pay careful attention to the dates and details associated\nwith their chosen program track and mode of study. Part-Time vs. Full-Time: All online and\nMid-Career students can complete their studies part-time. Residential students in the Early-Career\nand Early-Career Accelerated degree options are expected to be enrolled full-time. Specializations:\nThe residential options offer six specializations while the online options currently offer three\u00a0of these\nsix specializations. Q: Are there any in-person requirements for online MSIM students (orientation or\nexperiential learning)? A: No. We are working to develop several optional on-campus immersion\nprograms to enhance the learning experience for online students, but there are no graduation\nrequirements that require in-person participation. Q: How will the online courses be delivered? A:\nCourses delivered remotely have some synchronous (real-time) elements, but are mostly\nasynchronous so you can participate on your own schedule. Synchronous sessions will take place in\nthe early morning or evening Pacific time on weekdays and weekends (approximately 1 hour a\nweek, per course). Q: Will online courses be taught by iSchool instructors? A: All instructors\nteaching MSIM courses are iSchool faculty, which is composed of full-time core faculty and part-time\nguest faculty with deep industry and technical expertise. Online courses are designed and\ndeveloped by core full-time faculty to ensure a world-class academic experience and will be\ndelivered primarily by industry experts who infuse the courses with real-world case studies, practical", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2583, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c224cb03-fac9-4966-8340-c3407fe0976b": {"__data__": {"id_": "c224cb03-fac9-4966-8340-c3407fe0976b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "ischool_uw_edu_programs_msim_degree-options_residential-online.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\ischool_uw_edu_programs_msim_degree-options_residential-online.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10763, "creation_date": "2024-08-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "pdfs\\ischool_uw_edu_programs_msim_degree-options_residential-online.pdf_part_2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "ischool_uw_edu_programs_msim_degree-options_residential-online.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs\\ischool_uw_edu_programs_msim_degree-options_residential-online.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10763, "creation_date": "2024-08-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-24"}, "hash": "da341899a232dc54c013a7e3089cb0c6f12d276448fa72a8e09730bec396a4f1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "know-how and cutting-edge technical skills. Q: Do online students pay the same tuition and fees as\nresidential students? A: Yes. Tuition is based on the number of credits taken and the per-credit fee\nis the same for all students, regardless of state residency, program track or mode of study. In\naddition to tuition, students should budget for additional fees. Student fees assessed for the\nprevious academic year can be reviewed here and include a non-refundable registration fee for\nstudents in self-sustaining programs ($55 quarterly). These fees tend to increase annually and are\nassessed on all residential and online students. Q: Are international students eligible to apply? A:\nYes. However, online students will not be issued an F-1 visa or be eligible for Curricular Practical\nTraining employment authorization. Depending on an international student?s location, this may\nimpact their ability to seek employment or an internship. Q: What are the admission rates for the\nonline options? A: We cannot predict what the admission rates will be for the online degree options\nat this point. We will share this information as it becomes available. Q. Can I apply for both the\nresidential and online option? A: Prospective students are asked to carefully consider which degree\noption is right for them prior to applying. While it is not possible to apply to both the residential and\nonline options with a single application, candidates are able to submit more than one application\nshould they wish to apply for multiple options. Note that each application will require payment of a\nseparate application fee. Q: Can I apply as an online student if I live within driving distance of\nSeattle? A: Yes, all interested applicants are encouraged to apply. We anticipate many online\nstudents will live in or near Seattle. Q: Once admitted, is it possible to change delivery modes? A:\nNo. Once you are admitted to a program mode, either residential or online, you stay in that mode for\nthe duration of the program. Q: Can online MSIM students attend residential (on-campus) classes,\nor vice versa? A: No. All MSIM students will be required to take 100% of their coursework in their\ndesignated program mode, meaning online students will only take online courses. Residential\nstudents take most or all of their courses in-person on the Seattle campus, with some limited online\ncourse offerings.

In the coming decade, the Information School expects organizational leaders,\nengineers and designers of all kinds to ask a twofold question: How might AI be used to advance an\norganization's goals, and how, if at all, should it be used? To train the next generation of socially\nconscious, data-driven information leaders, we will create opportunities for students to learn how to\nanswer those questions. A specialization on AI is one step toward providing this education. The\nspecialization cements the iSchool?s commitment to offering a minimum of three classes specifically\nrelated to artificial intelligence each year to our graduate students. Q: What classes are included in\nthe specialization? Courses included in the specialization in the 2024-25 academic year are listed\nbelow. These courses may change as the fast-changing needs of organizations change and faculty\nexpertise develops. MT 589B Generative Artificial Intelligence Ethics | Caliskan | 4 credits | Autumn\nIMT 598B Epistemological Foundations of AI | Howe | 3 credits | Winter IMT 589C Implementing &\nManaging AI Systems | Sturman | 4 credits | Winter IMT 589F Large Language Models | Shah | 4\ncredits | Spring (IMT 574 is prerequisite) IMT 598A Responsible AI | Teodorescu | 3 credits | Spring\nQ: How many classes do I need to take to complete the specialization? Do I need to take all the\noffered AI courses? Students will need to complete three of the courses offered to complete the\nspecialization. We are offering five courses next year and hope that students will pick the three\ncourses that will support their academic and career goals. You are not required to take all the AI\nclasses to complete the specialization. We urge you to complete no more than three courses, to\npreserve room for your peers. Q: How technical is the AI specialization? Each class in the\nspecialization will require a different level of technical expertise to succeed. Our class on Large\nLanguage Models is the most technical and requires students to complete IMT 574: Machine\nLearning before taking the class. The remainder of the classes do not have prerequisites. Q: Is there\nany background knowledge I need to have to take the AI specialization? There is no background\nknowledge required for the AI courses beyond any prerequisites listed in the time schedule.

Our returning\nstudents, incoming ECA and MC students will not need to change their specialization and can take\nthese classes as electives. Incoming EC students who graduate in 2026 and are interested in\ncompleting the AI specialization should request to change their specialization. Current graduate\nstudents in the MSIM program offered online will have access to the online course we plan to create\nthis academic year. We plan to launch our first online course on artificial intelligence by spring 2025.\nQ: How does this impact prospective MSIM students? Prospective MSIM students opting for the\nresidential modality can select Artificial Intelligence as one of their choices in specialization during\nadmissions. Prospective online students can still select the three specializations we offer online.\nThis may change as we continue to develop our online curriculum. Q: Who has priority in registering\nfor AI courses? In the 2024-25 academic year, MSIM students will have priority in registering for\nthese classes. No other prioritization among MSIM students will happen this year. MSIM students\nwill be able to register for these classes as regular electives. Other iSchool students will have the\nopportunity to request an add code to join these classes in advance of the final registration period.\nNon-MSIM students will be able to join these classes during the final registration period, as they can\nwith all other specialization classes. During the 2025-26 academic year, we will run our normal\nregistration process for specialization classes. Q: If I cannot join the AI specialization, will I still be\nable to learn about how AI is transforming information management? Yes! We are integrating\nmodules related to artificial intelligence into all four of our core classes in both our online and\nresidential modalities.

The University of Washington\nreserves the right to change tuition and fees without prior notice, and tuition is expected to increase\nin the future. Note that the cost of the MSIM program is the same for both Washington state\nresidents and non-residents as well as the same whether you are residential or online. MSIM\nstudents are also eligible to receive financial aid to help cover the cost of tuition. Below is the tuition\ninformation for the Early-Career, Early-Career Accelerated, and Mid-Career MSIM tracks in the\n2024-2025 Academic Year : MSIM Tuition Rates for Incoming / First-year students for Autumn 2024:\nCost per credit = $1,074 Early-Career Accelerated track (40 credits): $42,960 Early-Career track (65\ncredits): $69,810 Mid-Career track (36 credits): $38,664 Rates for Continuing / Second-year\nstudents for Autumn 2024: Cost per credit = $1,016 Early-Career Accelerated track (40 credits):\n$40,640 Early-Career track (65 credits): $66,040 Mid-Career track (36 credits): $36,576 Additional\nInformation Tuition is the same for all students, regardless of residency. (There are no separate\nrates for in-state and out-of-state tuition.) Residential and online modes share the same tuition rates.\nTuition is based on the number of credits taken. Students who choose to take more credits than the\nnumber needed for the degree\u00a0will pay more than the total amount listed. Please take into account\nthat tuition increases each year. In addition to tuition, students should budget for additional fees.\nStudent fees assessed for the previous academic year can be reviewed here and include a\nnon-refundable registration fee for students in self-sustaining programs ($55 quarterly). These fees\ntend to increase annually. The MSIM\u00a0program is fee-based (self-sustaining) and does not qualify for\nthe State Employee Tuition Exemption program. Financial aid awards (loan packages) for\nMid-Career MSIM\u00a0students are limited to tuition only (up to 5 credits) and will not cover living\nexpenses. Students who will need a loan package that will cover more than part-time tuition should\napply for the Early-Career\u00a0MSIM\u00a0program options. In order to accept the offer of admission,\napplicants are required to pay a $500 non-refundable deposit, which will go toward their autumn\nquarter tuition.

Scholarship deadlines tend to be in mid-winter. You may not have your\nadmissions decisions by the time deadlines occur. Do your research! Look for funding that will\nmatch your specific goals, background and interests. Submit the FAFSA at\nhttps://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa Most loans are based on the FAFSA, as are some\nscholarships.\u00a0 The priority deadline to submit the FAFSA for the UW is Jan. 15 each year. Ask for an\nadjustment. Financial aid for the first year is based on your income from the previous year. Once\nyou start school, you will probably not have the same income level if you?re no longer working or\nworking fewer hours. When your employment status changes, contact UW Financial Aid and update\nthem on your income. Also, let them know if you need to buy any items (such as a new computer) to\nsupport your studies.

You might also search for scholarships in the area of\nmanagement, which may include business intelligence and consulting. Suggested Scholarship\nDatabases There are a number of scholarship databases for you to search for funding based on\nyour specific background, interests and experiences. Look through our list of scholarships College\nScholarships Peterson?s Guide Fastweb Scholarships.com Access Scholarships Specific\nPopulations There are scholarship opportunities based on gender, ethnicity and disabilities and\nother diversity areas.

They are available in large loan amounts (up to $20,500 per year). They are based on the\n10-year treasury note and are at a higher interest rate. They are usually not subsidized, which\nmeans interest rates begin accruing immediately. They have different terms of repayment than\nundergrad loans. U.S. citizens and permanent residents are encouraged to fill out the FAFSA in\norder to be eligible to receive federal loans. Financial aid awards are managed by the UW Financial\nAid Office . Contact the UW Financial Aid Office at 206-543-6101 or osfa@uw.edu for information on\nadditional types of aid to help support you as a student. International students are not eligible to\nreceive federal loans from the U.S. government and have limited funding options. Additional\ninformation is available through the UW International Student Services Office . State aid varies\ndepending on where you live, where you plan to study and what you plan to study. You are advised\nto do your research. (Most of the Washington state funds focus on undergraduates, but there are\nsome funds available for specific diversity groups.)
